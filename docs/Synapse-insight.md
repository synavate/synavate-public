# Synapse Symmetrical Intelligence

- Enhancing the ability of people and machines to search through high vector space and find disparate connections amongst the noise.
- We are designing Synapse to find the connections that appear far but are not.
  - An experimental research project and the genesis of the Synavate project itself.
- We fundamentally believe that the opportunity for symmetrical intelligence augmentation is something to be explored.
- Our approach is a pipeline of Machine Learning tooling from the rudimentary to recent research explorations into Knowledge Graph generation based on model feedback.
