# Synavate Labs: 
# A "Research-ish" Product Development Organization.



### Our Projects so far:

- Synapse: Github Link (The backbone of the endeavour - semantic extraction using Knowledge Graphs and LLMs.. maybe)
- Orion Constellation Defensive AI Threat Intelligence: Github Link (Orion Hunts, Orion Agents, Cognitive Synthesis): Github Link
- Timeless Love (Never let those you love misunderstand your love for them): Github Link

- Lang
  - Python
    - Mojo (modular AI)
  - Typescript
  - Rust (Kind of insulting to the Rustaceans out there to put this on here so BLAZING FAST 🦀🔥)

## 📣 **ANNOUNCEMENT** 📣
**11 April 2024:** Synavate Labs is part of the Blackbird VC Giant's Program Q4 Cohort in Australia.

**17 March 2024:** Synavate is trying to nail down a simple implementation of the project in order to proove it's efficacy.

**View our proposed product offering and join our team of dreamers, technologists and dabblers.**

**Synavate || Synapse: Now a member of the Google Startup Program providing cloud infrastructure support & Guidance**
                       ***Also part of the MongoDB program***

**Synapse v0.0.3 POC** is now in **active development**, following a successful research phase, and launching on **GCP** for evaluation.
**Orion Constellation** is an active extension of the Synapse project borrowing from our experience.
This milestone marks a significant step forward in our project.

Watch this space for more updates as we progress! 🚀

## 🧬 What is Synavate Existing For?

Synavate Labs specializes in developing "sufficiently unlikely" tools that clarify and connect complex data sets across various domains. Our flagship tool, Synapse, is designed to go beyond mere data storage. It contextualizes and connects data, transforming it into meaningful insights. Synapse integrates data from different sources into a graph-based model, revealing hidden relationships across projects, industries, and academic subjects.

At Synavate Labs, our focus is on combining rigorous research with innovative product development. Our work with Synapse exemplifies our approach: making data not only accessible but also insightful and actionable. Our commitment is to deliver products and projects that illuminate the connections within data, providing clarity and value to our users in a complex information landscape.



## 🌟 Why Synapse?

We believe in the power of connection – in data and in people. Synapse is for those who seek clarity in complexity, from ambitious projects to aspirant professionals. It's about moving beyond lists and tables to a dynamic map of knowledge that grows and evolves with time.

The heart of modern data's value lies in its interconnections. Synapse leverages this by using graph structures to model not just data, but its interrelations, its context, its story. It's a tool for those who dare to delve deeper, seeking to understand not just the 'what' but the 'how' and 'why' of data.

We've seen how large companies use data, and database structures like graphs for recommendation and user mapping, but not the generalization.

## 🔭 Current Focus and Next Steps

- **Technical Feasibility:** Synapse is our most ambitious project yet and we're exploring the technology stack and technical feasibility with the resources available.
- **POC Development**: We're in the early stages, experimenting with basic datasets to forge the initial mappings that will form the backbone of Synapse.
- **Seeking Talent**: We're on the lookout for skilled front-end developers. Your expertise will be pivotal in bringing the knowledge graph to life, making it interactive, intuitive, and insightful.
- **Enhancement and Scalability**: Our journey is ongoing. We're continuously refining our algorithms to deepen and enrich the connections within our graph, driven by the innovation of the FOSS community.

## 🚀 Roadmap Features

- **🌐 Scalable Graph Map**: At Synapse's core is Memgraph, a powerful engine for robust graph management.
- **🧠 LLM Integration**: Enhancing the depth and relevance of our data through advanced language models.
- **🌌 Graph Attention Network (GAT)**: Leveraging GAT for advanced node clustering and uncovering intricate relationships within graph structures.
- **🚀 Vector Databases**: Utilizing cutting-edge retrieval methods, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithms, for precise and context-aware data insights.
- **🖥️ Framework-Agnostic Front End**: A canvas awaiting the touch of a passionate developer to create a user interface that's as dynamic as the data it represents.
- **🔗 Secure API**: A gateway to connect your data. We're building an infrastructure that supports a range of Database Providers, all backed by the robustness of Memgraph.
