## GPT4 tries to do Jabberwocky

In silicon realms where data streams,
And learning deep, in layers gleams,
There thrives the art of AI's dream,
'Midst tensor forests, a synthetic theme.

By moonâ€™s soft glow on datasets spun,
A battle 'gainst the Jabberwonk begun.
With algorithms sharp as slithy toves,
Through gyre and gimble, the researcher roves.

In bytes and bits, a chorus swells,
Of models trained in hidden dells,
Where mimsy networks weave their spells,
And thwart the foes with defensive shells.

So heed the tale of bytes and bits,
Of synthetic dreams where the future sits.
For in this whimsy, tech-infused plot,
Lies a truth that Carroll long had taught.
