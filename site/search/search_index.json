It's a platform where data isn't just stored \u2013 it's contextualized, connected, and made meaningful. Synapse merges diverse data sources into an intricate graph-based model, shining a light on the hidden links in projects, professional fields, academic subjects, and more. It's where data transforms into insights.</p>"},{"location":"#why-synapse","title":"\ud83c\udf1f Why Synapse?","text":"<p>We believe in the power of connection \u2013 in data and in people. Synapse is for those who seek clarity in complexity, from ambitious projects to aspirant professionals. It's about moving beyond lists and tables to a dynamic map of knowledge that grows and evolves with time.</p> <p>The heart of modern data's value lies in its interconnections. Synapse leverages this by using graph structures to model not just data, but its interrelations, its context, its story. It's a tool for those who dare to delve deeper, seeking to understand not just the 'what' but the 'how' and 'why' of data.</p> <p>We've seen how large companies use data, and database structures like graphs for recommendation and user mapping, but not the generalization.</p>"},{"location":"#current-focus-and-next-steps","title":"\ud83d\udd2d Current Focus and Next Steps","text":"<ul> <li>Technical Feasibility: Synapse is our most ambitious project yet and we're exploring the technology stack and technical feasibility with the resources available.</li> <li>POC Development: We're in the early stages, experimenting with basic datasets to forge the initial mappings that will form the backbone of Synapse.</li> <li>Seeking Talent: We're on the lookout for skilled front-end developers.
